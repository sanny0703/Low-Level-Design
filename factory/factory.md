# Factory  Design Pattern

### => &nbsp; we should go for factory pattern, when we need to create an object of some class based on th criteria provided

### => &nbsp; instead of writing that creation logic wherever we required, we keep that logic of creation in a Factory

### => &nbsp; Factory class will always be singleton, &nbsp; because we don't want to create multiple similar objects using multiple factories

# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

### abstract factory is similar to factory pattern, but instead of a single factory we use a factory of factories to create different objects
